    Execute ./myserver in the bin directory (where the test files are) once for
    every server you want to make(each in different terminals), with the port
    number associated to it. The ports in the server-info.txt file are 1234,
    5678 and 2345.

    Execute ./bin/myclient in the main directory (where the server-info.txt file
    is located), including the name of the file for the addresses, the number of
    connections and the file that you want to get retrieved. If there is at least
    one server up with the file (from the server-info.txt) it will retrieve the
    file, otherwise it will display why the file couldn't be retrieved. The new
    copied files will be stored in the main directory.
